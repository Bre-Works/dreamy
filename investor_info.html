        <h1>Support Dreamy</h1><br>
        <p>Dreamy has a wide range of user target, from children to adults. It is currently a free application. We plan to acquire money from a charged premium version of the app and some in-app purchases.</p>
        <p>Until today, Dreamy has no real competitors in the Android market.
          Of course there are many other To-Do's apps, but nothing specifically for recording 'dreams', in the way we do.
          Compared to the good old pencil and paper, Dreamy offers more advantages than paper. It offers features that a pencil and paper cannot do; a more organised view, notifications, and many more.</p>

        <p>Update the app to support more features including some in-app purchases, and release a premium version. Those are the new features that we are eager to work on:<br>
          <br>
          <b>- Cloud storage (premium):</b>
          We'll save your dreams in one big cloud, so that if you change or lose your device, your dreams are never lost.
          <br>
          <b>- Free time ideas (premium):</b>
          Write down the things that inspire you to dream, in the format of text or images.
          <br>
          <b>- Themes (in-app purchases):</b>
          Currently the theme is a simple dual-color, but we're sure you'd love to personalise. New themes can be unlocked by purchase.
          <br>
          <b>- Avatar (in-app purchases):</b>
          Wide range of character design to accompany your widget. New avatars can be unlocked by purchase.
